# Phosort
Small application for easily sorting large amounts of photos.
## Usage
First select your source folder with all the photos you shot then the folder you want the good photos to be. You now enter the application and see the first photo. With left and right arrow you can cycle through the pictures of that folder. Clicking arrow up will copy the currently displayed picture to your destination folder. 
This way you can easily grab the (seemingly) good photos from your big bulk of shot photos without having to copy and paste every single photo in the explorer.
